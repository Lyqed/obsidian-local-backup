> *To apply settings immediately, click the `Apply settings` button.*

> *If you turn on interval backups, it is recommended to set a reasonable bakcup frequency, e.g. >=10min, this plugin costs CPU resources and Disk I/O resources, backup frequently will cause lagging.*

> *For user who owns a vault with large size, it is recommended to close the interval backups and only do a backup on startup.*
